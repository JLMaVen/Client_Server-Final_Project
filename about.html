            <hr>
                <h4> To help the poor in a sustainable manner and to ensure that they have access to clean air and water as well as productive soil, we must mobilize them to become active partners in the protection and rehabilitation of the environment. </h4>
                <h4> The poor are the most dependent on natural resources to meet their daily needs. However, with limited knowhow and options, their actions also contribute substantially to environmental degradation – slash and burn farming, cutting of wood including mangroves for charcoal-making, direct disposal of wastewater and solid waste to water bodies, and the like. Unfortunately, they are also the most adversely affected and the least capable of coping with the consequences of this degradation.</h4>
                <h4> Much of the success of Green Kalinga depends on how the values and principles pertaining to the environment are imbibed and practiced by GK residents, workers and volunteers. Even with the technical and advocacy support provided by Green Kalinga and its partners, these efforts are sustainable only when a shift of lifestyle is adopted by the GK communities. This is why each GK community is individually assessed and from here, the appropriate Green Kalinga components are implemented. </h4>

                <h4> GK Child & Youth Development nurtures and develops the young through an age-specific, values-based program that helps them reach their fullest potential. Many poor children are unable to attend school and enjoy studying because they have to scavenge for food or work very early in life to help their families. Education should be available to all, and we envision all the children and youth in our GK communities to live with dignity and be empowered to become heroes for God and country. This is done through three sub-programs:</h4>

                <h4> GK SIBOL (sibol meaning “to grow”) serves children ages 3 to 6 years old. It is a community-based pre-school program that envisions each child to be imbued with positive Filipino values and to be academically prepared for formal schooling.</h4>
                <h4> GK SAGIP (sagip meaning “to save”) is an acronym for Sagipin Ang Galing Isip at Pangarap ng mga Kabataan (save the talents, minds and dreams of the youth). It seeks to nurture the newfound hope of GK youth aged 7 to 13 through weekly values formation activities that promote love for God, country, family and fellowmen.</h4>
                <h4> GK SIGA (siga meaning “to give light”) seeks to empower the youth in GK communities aged 14 to 21 years old. Through weekly barkadahan (group of friends) sessions, the youth are provided with opportunities to hone their skills and talents that will make them patriotic and productive citizens of society.</h4>
                <h4> The GK Child & Youth Development (CYD) program also helps the youth by various values formation activities, technical & academic skills trainings, arts & crafts, and sports. GK SipaG (sipag meaning “diligence”) is a special project under GK CYD that seeks to develop underprivileged children through football/soccer. </h4>

            <h4> A Thousand Smiles and More </h4>
            <h5>by Arianne Rodriguez</h5>
            <h4>What makes you smile, a flashing view of a brand new gadget on your hands, a dashing designer cocktail dress, an expensive pair of sneakers…or a buffet of scrumptious food perhaps?</h4>
            <h4> Lovely sight that is, for sure.  For you, they’re worth the world on a spur of that moment when you discovered it’s all yours to have.</h4>
            <h4>On December 28, 2012, Gawad Kalinga saw thousands of those smiles during Operation Walang Iwanan Paraisong Pambata: A Christmas Party for Kids. Loaded with rice meals, brand new toys and slippers, boxes of milk, ice cream, candies and a lot more, the GK convoy conquered rain and thick fog late in the night of the 27th to reach the typhoon-struck land of Cateel and bring Christmas joy to the many kids who experienced the terror of Pablo and who might not have experienced Christmas as it should be.</h4>
            <h4>When the program and logistics were set, the kids were gathered inside the St. James church for the event opening. Cosplayers hyped them up with their dance numbers. Even Jollibee was there to dance and play with them. Oh how happy the kids were! You can only imagine their faces — emotions mixed with joy and amazement. Some of them have never even seen Jollibee or Cosplayers all their lives until then.</h4>
            <h4>One kid said, “Masaya po ako kasi ngayon lang po ako nakakita ng mga ganyan.” (I’m very happy because this is my first time to see things like this!)</h4>
            <h4>After the program came the food and gift giving. Amidst the heat of the noontime air, the little ones patiently waited for their turn. It’s definitely worth it, they say, because they don’t always receive gifts and most of them spent Christmas in makeshift shelters without food. What we brought would only suffice them temporarily, but the real message we wanted to share is the thought that “Christmas lives” even in times like this. Through it all, real friends will always be around — “Walang Iwanan”.</h4>
            <hr>
            <h4>Our Little Friends</h4>
            <h4>As all the kids were lining up, there was this one kid who was pulling a little wooden cart he actually made himself. He lined up happily and after receiving his food and gifts, he placed them in the cart and covered them secure with his old shirt. Shortly, he joined the other kids who have also received their gifts. We talked to him and found out that the 9-year old boy-with-the-cart’s name was Christian. His parents already died years ago. His younger sibling died during the typhoon. He usually stays around the plaza and the town’s people, out of concern, look after him every day. At the early age of nine, he had already experienced much of life’s difficulties. Yet at that moment, we didn’t see any trace of sadness in his face. He was happy that he received gifts, that he had milk and that he had seen us. If it was you in his place, would you feel the same?</h4>
            <h4> In the middle of our chats, another boy was sitting on a pillar behind us, eating. I noticed he didn’t finish his chicken meal so I asked him why. He said he’s saving it for later. He said the food was really delicious and he’s so happy he was able to eat such kind of food. Then I asked him if he can give me his leftover food instead because I haven’t eaten my lunch yet. It was a joke you know but guess what… He offered me the chicken meal he carefully saved up for the next time he becomes hungry!</h4>
            <h4>Of course I refused it and told him that he could keep it. I was very much inspired I could almost cry! He wanted the food so much, even divided it carefully so he can still eat it again soon after. But because I said I was hungry and asked if I could have it, without any second thought, he offered it to me. How generous!</h4>
            <h4>Yes, we brought them entertainment, food and gifts. But they gave us happiness and inspiration in return, such priceless presents.</h4>
            <hr>
            <h4>THANKS…</h4>
            <h4> It was one big party event for the children. As it happened in Cateel, the same program was simultaneously running in ComVal. When all's said and done, Gawad Kalinga was able to make roughly 3,000 kids (and 2,000 adults) feel the spirit of Christmas.</h4>
            <h4>Thanks to YOU who supported this delightful event for our dear children. Without you, this wouldn’t be realized. Big or small, your contribution has become the children’s joy. You know who you are. :)</h4>
            <h4>Until now, I believe it's not what you have lost that matters the most, it's what you STILL HAVE...that's the miracle. :) </h4>

            <h3> A Message from Billy Santos shared in GK Enchanted Farm official fb page @gkenchanted farm: </h3>
                <h4> “I feel blessed to be able to share knowledge I got from a good university and my experience as an agri-entrepreneur to these bright kids. I am also lucky to journey with friends I have met along the way - kindred spirits who are full of hope for the nation and the Filipino people, and brimming with passion to make a better world. Even though I am still young, I can say that I don't think there's a better way to spend the rest of my life."</h4>
                <h4> Arrived at GKEF 2 years ago, Billy Santos tells the challenges he faced when he decided to become a social entrepreneur and developed Kabutehan, a Filipino mushroom company.</h4>
                <h4> "When I quit my position as Physics instructor at a prestigious University, a lot of people had questioned my decision. Who wouldn't? It was a good first job for a fresh graduate while you took your graduate studies, thus opening more opportunities. I knew, however, that had I chosen this path for my career, it would have taken me away to another country. For most people I guess that's what they dream of, and I have nothing against it. It is a worthwhile dream to pursue. As for me, staying in the Philippines and finding a way build a great nation was always something that had a great appeal, something worth dedicating one's life to. So when I met Tito Tony and the rest of Gawad Kalinga during this period of my life, the decision to take the leap was easy. I quit my job and joined the team to start building the GK Enchanted Farm right then and there.</h4>
                <h4>This decision, however, met great disapproval. It could be summed up in the statement repeated to me over and over again by people around me: "Are you stupid? You went to a good university, had a good job, and now you are throwing all of these away to be a farmer?"</h4>
                <h4> The opposition to my decision, however, did not deter me from what I knew I had to do. I knew, even then, the immense opportunities that lay ahead; but beyond that, I knew this was something important to me, my future family, and my country. So rather than shake me from my decision, that statement set me towards building my own enterprise that will create sustainable opportunities for our farmers. I have started Kabutehan, an enterprise dedicated to building a globally leading mushroom industry that creates shared value for all the players, especially our Filipino farmers.</h4>
                <h4>I still teach now. I teach the kids of farmers how to do ratio and proportion, and see if they have the right number of male ducks for every female ducks at the farm. I feel blessed to be able to share knowledge I got from a good university and my experience as an agri-entrepreneur to these bright kids. I am also lucky to journey with friends I have met along the way - kindred spirits who are full of hope for the nation and the Filipino people, and brimming with passion to make a better world. Even though I am still young, I can say that I don't think there's a better way to spend the rest of my life."</h4>

              <h4>There are about 15M Filipino children who face the threat of not realizing their full potential – not growing to be as tall, as healthy, nor as bright as they can be – because they are suffering from hunger today as they grow up. The effects of hunger and poverty on children could become irreversible, especially if we’re not there for them NOW, when they need us the most. </h4>
              <h4> Though the problem is massive, we believe that ending hunger is possible. But for our response to have a commensurate impact, we must CARE TOGETHER. </h4>
          <h3>Kusina ng Kalinga is GK’s anti-poverty campaign to end hunger among Filipino children.</h3>
              <h4>Our kitchens cook daily nutritious lunch meals for children in public schools, in the streets, and in conflict areas to end hunger and malnutrition. But just as hunger is a condition that goes beyond empty stomachs, our model also goes beyond feeding.</h4>
              <h4>Our kitchens are also hubs for bayanihan, where parents, volunteers, teachers, school and community administrators, LGU’s, private individuals, organizations, and corporate partners are all essential for the KnK model to work.</h4>
              <h4> Through Kusina ng Kalinga, we build caring communities for our young. It is where lunchboxes don’t just contain meals, but also carry the commitment to care together until no child is left hungry.</h4>
              <h4>And as for the kids, each lunchbox builds hope - that because we are ending their hunger today, they can start imagining tomorrow</h4>
          <h3>We go where kids are. </h3>
              <h4>By providing lunch meals to kids who everyday are left with no choice but to face the threats of poverty, disaster, and/or conflict, we give their bodies the nourishment it needs so that they can have the fighting chance to grow up to their full potential. </h4>
          <h3>We cook by the thousands daily. </h3>
              <h4> Each Kusina ng Kalinga is scaled to cook up to 5,000 meals a day with parent volunteers serving as the backbone of our daily operations. Our kitchens prepare nutritious, balanced, and delicious lunch meals packed and distributed in colorful lunch boxes. </h4>
          <h3>We build communities.</h3>
              <h4>More than the food, the constant presence of a community committed to give kids the special care they need inspires in them something equally important – HOPE. And with this hope, our kids can start to look beyond hunger and dream brighter futures for themselves.</h4>
